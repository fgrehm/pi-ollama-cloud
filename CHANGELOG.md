# CHANGELOG

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-04-29

- Fix API key retrieval by using `AuthStorage` instead of `ctx.modelRegistry.getApiKeyForProvider`. The provider-level API key lookup was failing, causing auth to only work when an environment variable was set. Now reads from `auth.json` directly via the pi `AuthStorage` class.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-28

- Add `PI_OLLAMA_WEB_TOOLS` environment variable to optionally disable `ollama_web_search` and `ollama_web_fetch` tool registrations. Set to `0`, `false`, `no`, `off`, or an empty string to opt-out. The model provider and `/ollama-cloud-refresh` command remain active regardless.
